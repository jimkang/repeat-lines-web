yet-another-app
==================

This is a browser app that does some stuff.

Installation
------------

    npm install
    npm install wzrd -g

Usage
-----

    make run    

Or run [wzrd](https://github.com/maxogden/wzrd) directly:

    wzrd index.js

Then, wzrd will say something like:

    wzrd index.js
    server started at http://localhost:9966

You can open your browser to that.

Run tests with `make test`.
